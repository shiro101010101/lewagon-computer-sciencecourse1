    "🧑🏻‍🏫 What is the CLT ? According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in many situations, when independent random variables are summed up, their properly normalized sum tends towards a `Gaussian/normal distribution` (informally a `bell curve`) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. The theorem is a key concept in probability theory because it implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions."

## Text Review Classification (Optional)

As we have seen during Day 03, some product categories correlate with a lower `review_score` even after controlling for `wait_time`.

In this section we will try to analyze the trove of information contained in customer reviews in order to understand what are main customer pain points.

Our goals are:
- Help uncover new features to model out `review_score`
- Help product category leaders understand what are the issues with their product categories.

### One-star vs Five-star topics

- Using NLP techniques covered in week 4 and week 6 identify the main topics that distinguish low and high `review_score` orders.

### Product categories topics

- Are you able to identify topics for low review order and cluster those by  `product_category`? Which recommendation would you give to some of product category leaders?

ðŸ’ª (Optional): Start the next day with the first exerice. This week can be done at your own speed!

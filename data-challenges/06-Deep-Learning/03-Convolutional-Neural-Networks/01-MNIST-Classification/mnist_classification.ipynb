You deal everyday with a enourmous amont of letters, and you want to automate the process of reading the numbers that have been handwritten. This task, called the _Handwriting Recognition_, has been a very complex that has been handled by Bell Labs (among other) where Yann Le Cun used to work, and where such things have been developed : \n",
